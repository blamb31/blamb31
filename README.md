Hey I’m Blake Lamb. I’m a Full Stack Web Developer currently working for 1-800 Contacts. I enjoy learning and working with JavaScript based frameworks. I mainly work with Angular, Vue and Node, but have also worked with other technologies like React, C#, Python and others. 

In my free time I like to do things with my family, play many different sports and watch the Utah Jazz. I also really enjoy going camping and visiting State and National Parks. 

I’m currently learning more advanced Javascript concepts as well as some newer technologies like NgRx and Deno. I’m looking to collaborate on a cool open source technology or non-profit project, but I don't really know how to get involved, so I'm trying to break into that. If you're looking to reach me, you can email me at blake.lamb.dev@gmail.com. You can also find more about me on my website, blakelamb.com
